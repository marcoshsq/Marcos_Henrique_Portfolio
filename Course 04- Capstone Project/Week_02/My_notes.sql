We’ve done the prep, now it’s time to dive in and start executing our Project Proposal.
You’ve done the hard part; making the plan.  
Now it’s time to get to the fun part!  
Start looking at your data and perform some initial stats to get a good feel about what you have available to you.

This will build on your cursory exploration in Module 1 and Module 2. 
You may have already gone deeper, if so, that’s OK; you’re ahead of the game! 
In this module you’ll focus your efforts on understanding the ins-and-outs of the data and perform some descriptive stats.  
This will give you a solid grounding in your dataset and be able to EXPLAIN the data and your findings.

Clients often (even though they know their data) will ask questions about what you present, 
like “How did you come to this conclusion? Does our data cover x, y, and z? I didn’t know that ‘a’ was connected to ‘b’!”
You will face these types of questions and more, so having a solid foundation in what you are analyzing is a must. 

Keep your questions and your hypotheses in mind; 
it’s very easy to start down “rabbit-holes” and have to bring yourself back up for air to realize that you lost time chasing that rabbit.  
Nonetheless, it’s part of the journey

What if your hypothesis is wrong? No problem!

You've discovered a relationship that was thought to be present but isn't! 
That's great analysis! So now what?

Yes, sometimes we may go down a path that is a dead-end, and that’s OK.  
If all your paths are barren, pick a new path, but don’t stop; 
keep moving forward!

Document your discovery … this may be something your client didn’t know or was an assumption they made as well.

Insights are insights and data is data … you are not responsible for what the data says, it just is. 
Your job is to let the data speak to you.

What if your hypothesis is right? Yay for you

You discovered something out of your initial analysis of the data, relationships and assumptions that proved to be true. Now what?

Start thinking about how to characterize that finding? What’s the story you want to tell?

How best to tell it? You can think about visually, just key points, a narrative, or use the raw data?

Iterate on these steps to get a few good hypothesis/questions to answer and prove out.
