Now that you’ve completed your analysis, it’s time to tell the story.  
In this milestone, we will look at different ways we can present your findings.  
Many presentations to management are via presentation software such as MS Powerpoint / Apple KeyNote / Google Slides and are typically static: 
bullet points and clipped charts. 

Sometimes, however, you may want a more dynamic approach to tell the story.  
It all boils down to understanding your audience and the goal of your presentation.  

“Who?” 
Who are you presenting to?

- Colleague? Team?
- Your Manager/Supervisor?
- Sr. Management?
- Customer?
- External audience?

“Why?”
Why do you want to present to this audience?

- Sharing process and findings?
- Status / Plans?
- Seeking additional funding? Strategy Setting?
- Insights for customers?
- Education or case studies?

“What?”
What should you share?

- What level of detail?
- More text / More visualization?
- Key points or nitty-gritty code snippets?
- Bottom line info or high level trends?
- Sensitive Data or publicly consumable?

"How?"
It all depends on the above … 

Typically, the higher up the “ladder” you present, the less detail you are providing; 
this doesn’t mean that you won’t be asked detailed questions (that you’ll need to have answers for),
but you typically will have less time to communicate.

For Status/Plans, Strategy, Funding, Education/Case Studies, these are typically good places to use presentation 
software to gather your results and place your data in a position to tell the story.

Start at the 10,000 foot level view and work your way down to what’s closest to the audience and end with your “ask” or your “key points”

Don’t fill your slides with text, just bullets to guide you

“A picture is worth a thousand words” … if you can create a graphic to tell the story (charts, infographics) then do it!

When sharing the process and findings or working directly with customers on insights -- these are good opportunities to use more dynamic techniques

Software like Jupyter notebooks combined with markdown, code, charts, and results allow you to be flexible 
and respond to what-if questions more easily. You’ll be in your working environment and can show not only 
what you did to get to your results, but the results themselves. If you need to try something, you can.

Software like Tableau allows you to build visualizations and storyboards connecting to differing data sources 
locally or remotely. This is great for quick exploratory analysis and putting together findings quickly as well.
