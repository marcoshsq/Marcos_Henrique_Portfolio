Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. 
You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer.
You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." 
It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. 
If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.

Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding.

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000 
ix. review table = 10000 
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000

SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table_name (Table names are found in the schema.)
	
******************************************************************************************************************************************************************

2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (id)
ii. Hours = 1562 (business_id) 
iii. Category = 2643 (business_id_
iv. Attribute = 1115 (business_id)
v. Review = 10000 (id) , 8090 (business_id)
vi. Checkin = 493 (business_id)
vii. Photo = 10000 (id), 6493 (business_id)
viii. Tip = 537 (user_id), 3979 (business_id)
ix. User = 10000 (id)
x. Friend = 11 (user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	

SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(key))
FROM table_name (Table names are found in the schema.)

Yes, but also the amount of time that they have been yelping. The longer they have been yelping and the more reviews they give, the higher the fan count.

Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
		
Yes, but there seems to be a big outlier, number three Harald. 

Zero other users seem to have a more `useful` and `funny` correlation results in more fans, but also in conjunction with review_count and time they have been screaming.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis.

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

ratings operates for longer hoursthan the one with 4-5 star ratings.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
        Yes they have different number of reviews. 
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

No, I wasn't able to infer anything since two groups had different zipcodes.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT B.name
	,C.category
	,B.city
	,B.postal_code AS zipcode hours
	,CASE 
		WHEN stars BETWEEN 2
				AND 3
			THEN '2-3 stars'
		WHEN stars BETWEEN 4
				AND 5
			THEN '4-5 stars'
		END AS rating
	,B.review_count AS reviews
FROM business B
INNER JOIN hours H ON B.id = H.business_id
INNER JOIN category C ON C.business_id = B.id
WHERE city = 'Phoenix'
	AND category = 'Restaurants'
	AND rating IN (
		'2-3stars'
		,'4-5 stars'
		)
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY stars DESC;
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

The average review count was 9 points more for businesses that is open than the business that is closed.
	 
******************************************************************************************************************************************************************
         
ii. Difference 2:

The number of distinguished business_id for the one that is open is 5 times greater than the business that is closed, and therefore the
the average review count is higher for companies that are open.
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id)
	,COUNT(DISTINCT city)
	,AVG(stars)
	,AVG(review_count)
	,is_open
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open;

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

I chose to analyze whether companies like restaurants with attributes such as 'goodforkids', 'alcohol', and 'free Wi-Fi'
either way relates to the number of stars or the comment counts they receive. I particularly chose the state 'Arizona' as this state has more
number of restaurants, has review counts ranging from lowest to highest, and ratings from 2 to 4.5 stars for my review.
         
******************************************************************************************************************************************************************
	 
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
I used 3 tables as business, category, and attribute for my analysis.
I chose the name of the company, its category, the state in which they run, the attributes they have, their ratings, and their count of
assessments. I took variables like:

1) Name, state, stars, review_count from table business;
2) Table category;
3) Name, the value from the attribute table.

To connect all 3 tables. I used primary keys like business id, category business_id and
business_id from the attribute table.
                 
I wish I knew how to have free Wi-Fi or kid-friendly restaurants or have a full bar or have any combination of 2 or all of the attributes
contributions to a good rating or have more comments in private.
