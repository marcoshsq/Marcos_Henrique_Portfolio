Which of the following are benefits of segmenting data in different tables?

Easier data manipulation:

When we want to update a record or change something,
when that data isn't touching all different levels, it's a lot easier to
manipulate within tables.    

--

Efficient storage:

When we split out the information into separate
tables, it helps us store the data more efficiently, so we're not duplicating
records.    

--

Logically models a process within a business, so it can
help understand the way a business works in the real world:

How we break the data down into tables is often
modeled after a business problem or a business process.    

--

Greater scalability:

Breaking data into tables allows us the opportunity to
scale the information.    */

/* Joins:

- Associate correct records from each table on the fly;
- Allows data retrieval from multiples tables on one query;
- Aren't physical, they persist for the duration of the query execution.
