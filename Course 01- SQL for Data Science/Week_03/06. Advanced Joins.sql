/*Left Joins vs Right Joins:

Left Joins returns all the records from the left table (table 01), and the 
matched records from the right table (table 02).

The result is NULL from the right side if there isn't a match.

Right Joins returns all the records from the right table (table 02), and the 
matched records from the left table (table 01).

The result is NULL from the left side if there isn't a match.
