Hello, welcome to my Project Portfolio, my goal here is to highlight some of the most relevant projects I've developed related to programming and data science.

<h2 align="left">Data Science Certificates:</h2>

I know the best way to demonstrate your skills is through finished projects, but as I like to say, you need to learn things somewhere and certificates and courses are at least an indicator of interest.

So, if you're interested in seeing what field-relevant certificates I hold, I've created a curriculum based on university courses in data science and statistics. In this repository are not only the courses, but also the certificates I obtained and the projects I developed during the courses.
